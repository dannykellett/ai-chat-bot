## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
- **OpenAI API Reliability**: Implement retry logic, fallback responses, and graceful degradation
- **Streaming Complexity**: Thoroughly test SSE implementation, have polling fallback
- **Database Performance**: Start with SQLite, plan PostgreSQL migration path
- **CORS Issues**: Properly configure CORS early, test across browsers

### Timeline Risks
- **React Learning Curve**: Provide detailed documentation, implement incrementally
- **Feature Creep**: Strictly follow MVP approach, defer nice-to-haves
- **Testing Overhead**: Implement tests alongside features, not after
- **Integration Complexity**: Use feature flags for gradual rollout

## Success Metrics
- **Backend Performance**: <200ms API response time, >99% uptime
- **Streaming Quality**: <100ms time to first token, smooth updates
- **Code Quality**: >80% test coverage, passing linting/type checks
- **User Experience**: <3s page load, intuitive navigation
- **Learning Goals**: Clear React patterns, well-documented code

## Parallel Work Streams

### Independent Tracks
1. **Backend Development**: Can proceed independently of frontends
2. **Streamlit UI**: Can be developed once API contracts are defined
3. **React Setup**: Can begin project structure while backend develops
4. **Documentation**: Can be written alongside implementation
5. **DevOps Pipeline**: Can be set up in parallel with development

### Coordination Points
- API contract definition (Week 2)
- Authentication strategy alignment (Week 3)
- File handling specifications (Week 5)
- Deployment architecture (Week 11)

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Set up development environment with .gitignore and dependencies
2. Create FastAPI application structure
3. Implement database models and migrations
4. Build first API endpoint with tests
5. Create minimal Streamlit UI for testing

This workflow provides a structured 12-week path from empty repository to production-ready dual-frontend AI chatbot, with clear deliverables, risk mitigation, and parallel work opportunities.
